# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (8 September 2014)

 * Initial release.
 * Does everything the Ruby version does, super fast! (V8 optimizations lead to
   most benchmarks being roughly ~50% faster on NodeJS 0.10.31 vs MRI 2.1.2)
 * Should be API compatible with the most recent release of the Ruby version of
   the library.  Setting the version number accordingly.  Minor releases will be
   versioned independently, but will make an attempt to keep major version
   numbers consistent to feature set across different platforms.
